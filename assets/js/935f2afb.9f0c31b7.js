The DolDoc is a filetype, but that does not do it justice. The DolDoc is closer to a Microsoft Word file than a txt file, but more streamlined and with many of the technical aspects exposed to the user.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"exploring/keybindings":{"id":"exploring/keybindings","title":"Keybindings","description":"Before continuing we should acknowledge some pre-defined keybindings which will become helpful in the following pages and chapters. It\'s about time we put such a creation to good use. It\'s alright if you don\'t understand the functionality of each keybinding, as their uses will be explored throughout this site. For good practice; keybindings are seperated into sections based on where they appear throughout this site. E.g, the \\"Essential\\" keybindings are highly important and are first introduced in the \\"Exploring Deeper\\" (or this) chapter.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"exploring/programs":{"id":"exploring/programs","title":"Programs","description":"Now that we\'ve understood the UI, let\'s explore some programs on TempleOS. From the start, we have two terminal sessions open and AutoComplete running on the screen. Let\'s close all three of these, start off by hiding AutoComplete with Shift+Alt+A, next close the two open terminals by pressing the close button in the right corner or by pressing our abort keybinding (Shift+Esc). Upon closing the running programs, we are exposed to our wallpaper. On the bottom is an immovable task list, above it is a program called \\"Adam\\".","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"getting-started/Diving In":{"id":"getting-started/Diving In","title":"Diving In","description":"After installing, and booting into TempleOS you\'ll be greeted with TempleOS\'s holiest and simplistic bootloader, from here just enter 1 to boot into the C drive.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"getting-started/installation":{"id":"getting-started/installation","title":"Installation","description":"So the time has come; you want to purify your system? Well, unfortunately, it\'s not that easy. Running TempleOS on bare metal is somewhat of a challenge as TempleOS was only made for select hardware. Fortunately, running TempleOS is possible under a Virtual Machine.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"intro":{"id":"intro","title":"Introduction","description":"The Temple Operating System is a biblically inspired lightweight, ring-zero operating system (OS) that represents the prophesied Third Temple.
