# Roadmap
Here I'll write things that I want to do so I remember them, plus dates and when they are completed.
## 6 October 2022
* Write HolyC Docs.
* Implement HolyC Syntax support with Prism > https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/code-blocks#supported-languages.
* Add HolyJS ( by leozamboni ) interpreter to site. 
* Replace HolyJS' syntax highlighting with my custom prism HolyC implementation.
