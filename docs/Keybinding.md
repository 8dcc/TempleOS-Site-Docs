# Keybindings

Before continuing we should acknowledge some pre-defined keybindings which will become helpful in the following pages and chapters. It's about time we put such a creation to good use. It's alright if you don't understand the functionality of each keybinding, as their uses will be explored throughout this site. For good practice; keybindings are seperated into sections based on where they appear throughout this site. E.g, the "Essential" keybindings are highly important and are introduced in the First Chapter.

> <kbd>❖</kbd> (Super Key) refers to the Windows Key or <kbd>⌘</kbd> on Mac.
