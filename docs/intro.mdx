# Introduction
[The Temple Operating System](https://www.templeos.org/) is a biblically inspired lightweight, ring-zero operating system (OS) that represents the prophesied Third Temple.

Regardless of your opinions on the creator or the goal of TempleOS, we can all agree that it is a masterpiece. Unlike most (dare I say "all") operating systems, TempleOS and its components were solely created by one person; from the compiler, kernel, and all the programs within it, to even the software it was built in. Terry Davis truly is the smartest programmer to ever live, and will always be.

This site will hopefully unravel the beauty of TempleOS, so if you're a person who'd like to learn TempleOS, or even a person who is skeptical about the practicality of TempleOS; then this site is for you. It is worth mentioning that all information on the site assumes you have a fundamental understanding of Operating Systems, computing components, and optionally programming.
