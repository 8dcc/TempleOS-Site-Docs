_Whether you are an experienced programmer or not, this website is intended for everyone who wishes to learn the C programming language._

TempleOS uses it's own C-varient called HolyC; meant to be just inbetween C and C++ (hence being originally called C+). Instead of being compiled into a binary before use like C (this is known as Ahead-of-time compilation), HolyC is ran and compiled at the same time (this is known as JIT Compilation or; Just-in-time), in fact TempleOS is compiled at boot-time. This makes writing code in TempleOS is quite simple. HolyC is very similiar to C and C++ but has its own way of doing things. Unfortunately, at the time being, HolyC's only practical use-case is within TempleOS, though some intepreters and compilers to exist for other systems.

In this Guide, you'll learn how to code in HolyC, and write your own programs!
