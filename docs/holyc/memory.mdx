# TempleOS Memory

## Pointers

TempleOS uses a shared memory space between tasks. This means you can access a tasks memory from any other task.
But before we can do this,we need to know how to access memory(or even what memory is).

Memory looks something like this:

```holyc
//This is 16kb of memory.
U8 RAM[65536];
```
It looks like a table and you can store or load values from `RAM`.

```holyc
U8 RAM[65536];
RAM[0]=1; //Arrays in TempleOS start at 0
RAM[1]=2;
RAM[2]=3;
"RAM[0] is %d\n",RAM[0];
```

Pointers are the index in RAM a value is.

```holyc
U8 RAM[65536];
I64 pointer=356;
RAM[pointer]=10;
I64 value=RAM[pointer];
```

Let's see a real-world example of a pointer

```holyc
//Use a '*' to make a variable into a pointer
//Double qoutes make a string in memory
U8 *pointer="ABCD"; 

"%d(%c)\n",pointer[0],pointer[0];
"%d(%c)\n",pointer[1],pointer[1];
"%d(%c)\n",pointer[2],pointer[2];
"%d(%c)\n",pointer[3],pointer[3];
"%d\n",pointer[3];
```

## Types of memory.

The most important part of RAM is being able to use it,but before we can 
use it we need to see how it is divided. There are two main types of memory in RAM:

 - Stack
 - Heap 

### Stack

The easiest one is called the *Heap*. This type of memory comes and goes when it is needed.
The second type is called the *Stack*. This memory does not come and go,**it is allocated when a 
function is called and doesn't change it's pointer**. Imagine a tower of blocks. The topmost block 
is where the current function is called,and the below blocks are where the parent functions are. 
You cannot remove a block from the bottom or the tower will fall,so we only place/remove blocks 
from the top

*Note that all local variables in functions are put on the stack.*

### Heap

Heap memory comes from *Random* locations in RAM that aren't reserved for anything.
It's like a cloud that is full of "random" data. To make some memory from the heap,we 
use `MAlloc`/`CAlloc` to get request some data from the computer.**And be sure to 
`Free` the data when you are done with it.**

```holyc
U8 *heap_ptr=MAlloc(STR_LEN);
StrCpy(heap_ptr,"I love the heap");
"Our heap pointer says:%s\n",heap_ptr;
//Bye Bye
Free(heap_ptr);
```

## Getting pointers

All local vairables in a function are allocated on the stack and you can get pointers to them
To do this,we use the `&` operator,we write into it using the `*` operator.
Let's see an example:
```holyc
U0 Foo() {
	I64 a=1,b=2,c=3;
	I64 *i64_ptr=&a; //We get the pointer here
	"Pointer of a is:%d\n",i64_ptr;
	//Here we use the '*' operator to write a value into the pointer
	*i64_ptr=100;
	"a's new value is :%d\n",a;
}
Foo;
```

## Pointer types.

In TempleOS,each variable has a type. This type also detirmines how big the variable is,
**AND** it also affects the "width" of the pointer. Let's see an example of how this is used

```holyc
U0 Foo() {
	//Each one of these dudes is 8 bytes.
	//The pointer to an I64 will move 8 bytes each "index"
	I64 array[3];
	array[0]=1;
	array[1]=2;
	array[2]=3;
	I64 *ptr=&array;
	"Look at the values,they increase by 8\n";
	"ptr+0 is %d\n",ptr+0;
	"ptr+1 is %d\n",ptr+1;
	"ptr+2 is %d\n",ptr+2;
	"\n";
	"*(ptr+0) is %d\n",*(ptr+0);
	"*(ptr+1) is %d\n",*(ptr+1);
	"*(ptr+2) is %d\n",*(ptr+2);
}
Foo;
```
