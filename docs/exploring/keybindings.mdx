# Keybindings
Before continuing we should acknowledge some pre-defined keybindings which will become helpful in the following pages and chapters. It's about time we put such a creation to good use. It's alright if you don't understand the functionality of each keybinding, as their uses will be explored throughout this site. For good practice; keybindings are seperated into sections based on where they appear throughout this site. E.g, the "Essential" keybindings are highly important and are first introduced in the "Exploring Deeper" (<i>or this</i>) chapter.

### Essentials (Exploring Deeper):<br></br>
<kbd>Space</kbd> acts as a keyboard alternative for the Left Mouse Button (LMB).  <br></br>
<kbd>Enter</kbd> similar to the aforementioned, this acts as an alternative to the Right Mouse Button (RMB).  <br></br>
<kbd>F1</kbd> press to bring up Help Menu.  <br></br>
<kbd>CTRL+M</kbd> press to go to your Personal Menu.   <br></br>
<kbd>Escape</kbd> press to save and exit.   <br></br>
<kbd>Shift+Escape</kbd> press to abort and exit.   <br></br>
<kbd>Windows Key</kbd> hold to show the drop-down menu; navigate using arrow keys.<br></br>
<kbd>Ctrl+Alt+T</kbd> opens a new terminal.   <br></br>
<kbd>Ctrl+ALt+N</kbd> switches window.<br></br>
