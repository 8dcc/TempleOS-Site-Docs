# Keybindings

Before continuing we should acknowledge some pre-defined keybindings which will become helpful in the following pages and chapters. It's about time we put such a creation to good use. It's alright if you don't understand the functionality of each keybinding, as their uses will be explored throughout this site. For good practice; keybindings are seperated into sections based on where they appear throughout this site. E.g, the "Essential" keybindings are highly important and are first introduced in the "Exploring Deeper" (<i>or this</i>) chapter.

### Essentials (Exploring Deeper):<br></br>


| Keyboard Command | Explaination                                                                                |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Space`          | acts as a keyboard alternative for the Left Mouse Button (LMB).                             |
| `Enter`          | similar to the aforementioned, this acts as an alternative to the Right Mouse Button (RMB). |
| `F1`             | brings up the "Help Menu".                                                                  |

| `Escape`         | saves and exits.                                                                            |
| `Shift+Escape`   | aborts and exists.                                                                          |
| `Super`/`Win`    | hold to display the drop-down menu, navigate using the arrow keys.                          |
| `CTRL+ALT+N`     | switches window                                                                             |
| `CTRL+ALT+T`     | opens a new terminal window.                                                                |
