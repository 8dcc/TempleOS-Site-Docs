So maybe you aren't a fan of the way the TempleOS looks or feels, and you'd like to change something; then this guide is for you!

## Increasing the FPS

Perhaps you don't like how slow TempleOS can be, or maybe you just want to experience TempleOS's games in all their glory, in which case turning up your frames-per-second will do the trick!

In order to change the maximum FPS you'll need to edit the TempleOS kernel which is simpler than it seems. First, open the kernel source code:

```holyc
Ed("Kernel/KernelA.HH.Z")
```
