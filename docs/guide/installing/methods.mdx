# Installation

This wouldn't be much of a docuementation of we didn't cover how to properly install TempleOS, the method's and their respective benefits.

Installing TempleOS can be a tedious task to install on [Bare Metal](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/2153/bare-metal) primarily because of the hardware it accepts - or rather doesn't accept. TempleOS wasn't built with large libraries and drivers (considering its size, this is self-explanatory), and as such doesn't work on most hardware. As a result, for this installation we have both methods for Hardware and Virtualized installations.

## **Benefits / Disadvantages**

The Advantages or Disadvantages below are labeled as such based on how the average user would view them, and does not reflect the opinion of TempleOS Simplified.

### Hardware

- Installing on baremetal allows you to use TempleOS as it was intended; a stand-alone operating system. ðŸ”¥
- Forcing yourself to use TempleOS, allows you to properly gain an understanding of lower level programming. ðŸ”¥
- Limited hardware support as mentioned before. Generally only older PCs are able to run it; like Thinkpads. ðŸ§Š
- May be difficult for the average user to install. ðŸ§Š

### Virtualized

- Virtualizing any system, generally stops bugs from ending up on your system. ðŸ”¥
- Can be installed in only a couple of minutes on any 64-bit PC (Windows/Linux/Mac). ðŸ”¥
- Requires an OS to already exist on the PC. ðŸ§Š
- Can have a limited feel to it; certain features don't work on certain virtual machines like audio (VirtualBox). ðŸ§Š
